The legal basis is identified in the execution of the tasks of public interest
or in any case connected to the exercise of public powers by AGID, pursuant to
article 14-bis of Legislative Decree no. 82/2005 (“Codice dell’Amministrazione
Digitale”), as well as in AGID’s role as national PEPPOL Authority. AGID,
indeed, is the Italian national PEPPOL Authority as a result of joining
OpenPEPPOL, an international association whose members belong to both the public
and private sectors and which is responsible for developing and maintaining the
PEPPOL technical specifications, building blocks, services, and implementation
across Europe.

**Categories of processors of personal data**

AGID will process personal data independently through its own staff.

The personal data processors are also providers of technical and telematic
services if they are designated as such.

AGID, as national PEPPOL Authority, does not transfer any personal data to third
countries or to international organisations.

 

**Retention period of personal data**

Browsing data are deleted immediately after the related statistical processing
and, in any case, are not kept for more than 15 days from the time of
collection, without prejudice to any need for the detection of crimes by the
judicial authority.

The personal data provided by the data subjects are kept for the time strictly
needed for the management and feedback of the communication received.

 

**Rights of the data subjects**

Data subjects have the right to obtain access, correction or cancellation access
to their personal data, the limitation of the related processing, the right to
object and the right to data portability, where the conditions exist.

Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial appeal, it is the
right of the data subject to file a complaint with the Data Protection Authority
if it is deemed that the processing of their data violates the Regulation.

AGID guarantees that no exclusively-automated form of decision-making that
entails legal effects on the data subjects is in place.

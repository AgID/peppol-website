The Italian PEPPOL Authority launched a consultation process on the PEPPOL BIS Despatch Advice 3.0 (DDT), from 16 to 27 March 2020, in order to establish the national PEPPOL standard for the Despatch Advice.

The comments received following the public consultation are listed below. All comments have been resolved and the technical specifications have been updated accordingly, as specified in their release notes. No comments were received regarding the business rules for DTT 3.0.

Please note that the aforementioned consultation and approval process does NOT currently have any impact on the functioning of the Nodo di Smistamento gli Ordini di Acquisto (NSO), which will continue to manage only the PEPPOL BIS 3 order formats relating to Orders, as stated in the technical rules of the MEF.

From now on, the Italian PEPPOL BIS Despatch Advice 3.0 profile can be used for software developments.

The Authority's test environment can be used to perform the tests relating to the profile in question, after contacting [assistancePEPPOL@agid.gov.it](mailto: assistancePEPPOL@agid.gov.it).

The deadline for the migration of the DDT is set for 30 September 2020, by which date the Service Providers will have to stop using the PEPPOL BIS 30A profile.

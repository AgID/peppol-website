AgID, as Italian PEPPOL Authority, is supporting the migration of post-award PEPPOL profiles adopted nation-wide, as established by the [OpenPEPPOL migration plan](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/upgrade-3/migration/).

As is well known, the PEPPOL BIS 3 profiles relating to Orders have already been adopted at national level, in compliance with the NSO technical rules issued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF).

In order to allow the correct and continuous operation of the services that make use of PEPPOL in Italy, AgID, as PEPPOL Authority, has opened a **consultation** process on the **PEPPOL BIS Despatch Advice 3.0 (DDT)**, so as to establish the National PEPPOL specification for the Despatch Advice.

The aforementioned consultation and approval process does NOT currently have any impact on the functioning of the Nodi di Smistamento degli Ordini di acquisto (NSO), which will continue to manage only the PEPPOL BIS 3 order formats relating to Orders, as explained in the technical rules of the MEF.

Any future change to the NSO, aimed at supporting DDT, will be communicated by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and will also be confirmed by AgID.

The draft specification on PEPPOL BIS Despatch Advice 3.0 can be consulted at this [link](https://notier.regione.emilia-romagna.it/docs/) [PEPPOL BIS 3 section (other processes)].

The consultation roadmap includes:

- **March 19, 2020** - 2.30 pm - 3.30 pm - webinar for the presentation of the PEPPOL BIS National Despatch Advice 3.0;
- **March 27, 2020** - closure of the consultation and final date for sending comments;
- **April 6, 2020** - publication of the final version of the specifications of the PEPPOL BIS National Despatch Advice 3.0.

OpenPEPPOL has notified the release of new PEPPOL BIS 3.0 updates to the Post-Award Community (PoAC). We kindly ask you to review it by consulting the [Release notes](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/upgrade-3/release-notes/) for version 3.0.4.

Amongst the different types of post-award documents, the changes introduced also concern electronic order formats. However, the changes, which are corrective and adaptive in nature, following a preliminary analysis, do not impact on the specifications for interoperability with the NSO system.

The technical specifications updated with this Spring Release will come into force on May 15, 2020.
